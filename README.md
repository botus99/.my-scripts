# .my-scripts
These scripts help with optimizing media archival, updating applications, and generating basic text.  ðŸ‘€

## ðŸ“– Description
Behold! Here are a bunch of scripts that I use sometimes (quite descriptive, I know). I use Python to keep usage between operating systems as uniform as possible, but some are still written as Windows batch files. I had to start somewhere.

I am converting the leftover batch files over to Python in my spare time. These scripts serve various purposes, ranging from automating repetitive renaming tasks to encoding videos to my preferred 10-bit h265 format with ffmpeg and nvenc. The repository is open for others to explore, use, or modify if they find the scripts helpful. ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ’» Usage
You can clone the repository to your machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/botus99/.myscripts.git
```
The scripts are mostly meant to run within the current working directory. Copy/pasting these scripts as needed should do the trick! 
Keep in mind that some scripts may require specific dependencies or configurations, specifically python, ffmpeg, jpegoptim, oxipng, mediainfo, and mkvmerge. Assuming your apps are installed and shims are working, these scripts should require zero setup.
