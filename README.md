# .my-scripts
These scripts help with optimizing media for streaming or archival purposes, updating applications, and generating basic text. ðŸ‘€

## ðŸ“– Description
Behold! Here are a bunch of scripts that I sometimes use (quite descriptive, I know). I use Python to keep usage between operating systems as uniform as possible when I can, but some are still written as Windows batch files, and many are Bash scripts. I had to start somewhere.

These scripts serve various purposes, ranging from automating installation of retro bios files, to converting/recompressing .zip files to .7z, to encoding videos to my preferred 10-bit h265 format with ffmpeg and nvenc. The repository is open for others to explore, use, or modify if they find the scripts helpful. ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ’» Usage
You can clone the repository to your machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/botus99/.myscripts.git
```
The scripts are mostly meant to run within the current working directory. Copy/pasting these scripts as needed should do the trick! Or, if you're crafty, you can always link these to your somewhere in your $PATH to execute them as any other terminal application.

Keep in mind that some scripts may require specific dependencies or configurations, specifically python, ffmpeg, jpegoptim, oxipng, mediainfo, and mkvmerge. Assuming your apps are installed and shims are working, these scripts should require zero setup.
