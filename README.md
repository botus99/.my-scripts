# .myscripts
These scripts give you the power to automate those pesky repetitive tasks and streamline your workflow so you can get on with the fun stuff. You know what I'm talking about, right? ðŸ‘€

## ðŸ“– Description
Behold! My personal collection of media management scripts that I use regularly. Most of them use Python, but some are still written as Windows batch files. These scripts serve various purposes, ranging from automating repetitive renaming tasks to encoding 8-bit x264 videos to my preferred 10-bit h265 format. The repository is open for others to explore, use, or modify if they find the scripts helpful. ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ’» Usage
You can clone the repository to your machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/botus99/.myscripts.git`

The scripts are mostly meant to run within the current working directory. Copy/pasting these scripts as needed should do the trick! 
Keep in mind that some scripts may require specific dependencies or configurations, especially python, ffmpeg, and mkvmerge.
