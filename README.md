# .myscripts
random scripts that I use for basic media management

## ðŸ“– Description
MyScripts is a GitHub repository where I store my personal collection of scripts that I use regularly. These scripts serve various purposes, ranging from automating repetitive renaming tasks to encoding 8-bit x264 videos to my preferred 10-bit h265 format. The repository is open for others to explore, use, or modify if they find the scripts helpful.

## ðŸ’» Usage
Feel free to browse through the repository and use any script that you find useful. You can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/botus99/.myscripts.git`

Then, navigate to the cloned directory and execute the scripts using the appropriate command for your environment. Keep in mind that some scripts may require specific dependencies or configurations, especially python and ffmpeg.
