# .myscripts
These scripts help with optimizing media archival, updating applications, and generating basic text.  ðŸ‘€

## ðŸ“– Description
Behold! Here are a bunch of scripts that I use sometimes (quite descriptive, I know). I try to use Python to simplify use between operating systems, but some are still written as Windows batch files. I do intend to convert the batch files over to Python in my spare time. These scripts serve various purposes, ranging from automating repetitive renaming tasks to encoding 8-bit x264 videos to my preferred 10-bit h265 format (coming soon). The repository is open for others to explore, use, or modify if they find the scripts helpful. ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ’» Usage
You can clone the repository to your machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/botus99/.myscripts.git
```
The scripts are mostly meant to run within the current working directory. Copy/pasting these scripts as needed should do the trick! 
Keep in mind that some scripts may require specific dependencies or configurations, especially python, ffmpeg, and mkvmerge.
